# MeeCreeps RELOADED
**McJty's MeeCreeps!** .. but with shitty new features:
 * Open TeleportWheel everywhere! No need to target a block anymore! [WIP Horizontal/Vertical switch]
 * Custom Coordinates! Tune the portal gun to custom XYZ coords on-the-go. Screw having to visit places first! [WIP the whole thing]

## More Planned features:
 * Portal Gun self-destruct mechanism

## Disclaimer
This is literally my first time ever writing something in Java, no kidding.  
I don't know anything about the language and I'm relying only on my intuition + googel to glue things together. The code is most probably horseshit.
